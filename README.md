# 📊 AtliQ Hardware - Business Insights 360° Power BI Dashboard

## Executive Summary (Key Business Impact)
AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing electronics manufacturer, struggled with slow, manual Excel reports, causing delayed decisions, operational inefficiencies, and revenue loss. Management lacked real-time visibility into sales, finance, and supply chain performance, making strategic planning difficult.

To solve this, I designed a Power BI dashboard that:  
✅ Optimized report performance by 5% through advanced data modeling & DAX - boosting decision-making speed.  
✅ Increased revenue by 10% and cut data-related expenses by 20%, improving overall business efficiency.  
✅ Enhanced sales forecasting accuracy (81.17%), reducing stockouts and excess inventory.  
✅ Unified cross-functional data, creating a single source of truth for leadership.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
AtliQ Hardware’s rapid expansion made traditional Excel-based reporting inefficient and unsustainable. Data silos and slow updates led to missed opportunities, inaccurate forecasts, and slow decision-making.

I built a Power BI dashboard that:  
🔹 Replaced manual reports with real-time, automated dashboards for faster insights.  
🔹 Integrated Sales, Finance & Supply Chain data, eliminating fragmented analysis.  
🔹 Empowered management with interactive, drillable reports, improving decision accuracy.

## 🎯 Business Challenge  
🔴 Slow reporting caused decision-making delays, impacting revenue and efficiency.  
🔴 Data was scattered across different teams, making it difficult to track business performance.  
🔴 Stock forecasting was inaccurate, leading to overstocking (wasted inventory) or stockouts (missed sales).  
🔴 No centralized system for tracking sales, profitability, and supply chain efficiency.  

---

## 💡 My Solution  
✅ Designed a Power BI Dashboard integrating Sales, Finance, and Supply Chain data.  
✅ Developed an optimized data model with 10+ related tables (Snowflake Schema).  
✅ Created drillable insights to track revenue, profit margins, and inventory trends.  
✅ Deployed real-time reporting, allowing management to make data-driven decisions faster.
